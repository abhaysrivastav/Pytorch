        "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular, has led to improvements in the speed of radiological image processing and diagnosis. This speed-up has not come at the price of accuracy; cutting-edge algorithms are comparable to the current standard of care. The best human experts still outperform AI, so the technologies being developed serve as a complement to doctors and researchers, not as their replacement. Thus, it's important that those using these new tools attain some familiarity with their inner workings.\n",

        "## Deep Learning and Frameworks\n",
        "A generic deep neural network consists of a series of <em>layers</em>, running between the input and output layers. Each layer is comprised of <em>nodes</em>, which store intermediate numerical values. The values from each layer are fed to the next after linear transformation by a tensor of <em>weights</em> and a nonlinear <em>activation function</em>. This overall structure is called the <em>architecture</em>.\n",
        "\n",
        "In <em>supervised learning</em>, which we will be studying here, each input datum (X value) is provided along with a target output or label (Y value). The inputs can be very general types of data: images, sentences, video clips, etc. The outputs are often things like image classes, text sentiments, or object locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The X values are mapped through the network to outputs (Y predictions). The Y predictions are compared to the actual Y values, and the difference between them is quantified through a <em>loss function</em>. An <em>optimizer</em> varies the weights of the network over several iterations through the dataset, or <em>epochs</em>, in order to minimize the loss. This process is called <em>training</em> the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "By providing a large and detailed training dataset, creating an adequately complex network architecture, and training for a sufficient amount of time, the model should be able to predict the correct label for inputs that it has never seen before. Feeding new input into a trained model and making use of its predictions is known as <em>deployment</em>.\n",
        "\n",
        "The overhead to create and train networks with standard programming libraries is quite large. Fortunately, deep learning enthusiasts have done the heavy lifting in this process by creating specialized libraries, or <em>frameworks</em>, that allow us to condense what would be thousands of lines of tangled code down into a few dozen straightforward and readable ones. The framework used in this lab is PyTorch, which is on the beginner-friendly side while having its own technical advantages of interest to power users, too. Other popular frameworks include TensorFlow, MS Cognitive Toolkit, and MXNet, each of which has unique tradeoffs between ease of use, flexibility, speed, and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are also higher-level frameworks called <em>wrappers</em> that can be set up with simpler code or even graphical interfaces, that in turn are able to switch between several different lower-level frameworks with the setting of a single toggle. A popular code-based wrapper is Keras, while DIGITS is a graphical one.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code below, we load the PyTorch framework and other useful libraries. Due to the mathematically intensive nature of training, the code runs much faster on a GPU than on a conventional CPU, so we set parameters allowing for GPU acceleration.\n",

Also, some images also have a different scale - the background isn't black but gray. Because there's a smaller difference between pixels, our model might have a harder time extracting information from them. Thus, to increase the contrast, we first rescale every image so the pixel values run from 0 to 1. \n",

However, the activation functions tend to be most sensitive / nonlinear near zero. Therefore, shifting our data to have an average input value of zero will improve the sensitivity and stability of initial training steps and tends to speed things up a little.

        "The first is the <em>convolutional</em> layer. When interpreting an image, the eye first identifies edges and boundaries. Then, one can make out curves, shapes, and more complex structures at higher levels of abstraction. By only combining information from nearby pixels at first, a series of convolutional layers mimics this organic process. The size of the convolution is how many adjacent pixels are weighted and added up when moving to the next layer, and we can apply multiple convolutions to every pixel in an image (or in a higher layer). Pictured below is a single 3 × 3 convolution. The value of each pixel of the convolutional kernel - these are the weights that are trained - is multiplied with the corresponding pixel value within the neighborhood of the original, central image pixel. These products are summed up, and the total is placed in the central pixel (node, to use the nomenclature) of the new layer. The process is repeated for each pixel and each convolution within the layer. Several convolutional layers can be stacked on top of each other; this has the effect of finding increasingly complex features.\n",

        "After several convolutional layers, it is typical to have a few fully connected layers. First, all the information from the last layer is \"flattened\" into a vector. In a fully connected layer, there are weights connecting every single node (place to store a value) of the input layer to every single node of the output layer - no special preference is given to neighboring nodes as in the pixels of a convolutional layer. The weights multiply the values in the nodes of the input layer, are summed together, and then placed in a node of the output layer. This is repeated for each node in the output layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, there is one additional step in each of these that has been omitted: appication of the activation function. If the linear function `y = 3x + 2` is composed with `z = 4y - 7`, then z is still a linear function of x: `z = 12x + 1`. The same thing is true for linear functions in higher dimensions (multiplication by weights and summing, as we have been doing). Without the activation function, no matter how many layers we stack together, it could ultimately be replaced by a single one. To avoid this, at each output layer, we apply a nonlinear activation function. This need not be the same function at every layer. In this architecture, we choose <a href=\"http://image-net.org/challenges/posters/JKU_EN_RGB_Schwarz_poster.pdf\">ELU</a> functions, but there are many other popular options, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)\">ReLU</a>.\n",

        "\n",
        "First, we define the hyperparameters of the training. The learning rate reflects how much the model is updated per batch. If it is too small, the training proceeds slowly. If it's too large, the weights will be adjusted too much and miss the true minimum loss, or even become unstable. An epoch is a full run through the training data. Some models require thousands of epochs to train; this one will produce high accuracy with just a handful.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use validation data to prevent overtraining in our model. The training and validation data are drawn from the same set of data; therefore, the model ought to have similar loss for both. Thus, we set a limit on how much larger the validation loss can be than the training loss. Because random fluctuation might account for some discrepancy, we require a few epochs pass with high validation loss before halting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The memory overhead required to feed large datasets through the model can be prohibitive. <em>Batches</em> are an important workaround for this problem. By loading smaller data subsets onto the GPU and training off of them, we can not only save memory, but also speed up the training by making more adjustments to the model per epoch. Smaller batches generally require smaller learning rates to avoid instability, however, so there is some tradeoff.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine that a dataset had only a handful of examples of a particular label. The model could still acheive high accuracy overall while totally ignoring these. Using weights in the loss function, with larger weights for less numerous classes, is one strategy to combat this. If a class is particularly tiny, however, it is preferable to use data augmentation to generate new images rather than using weights alone, which are equivalent to feeding the same image over and over again through the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we move on to the actual training loop. The first real step is to shuffle the data before slicing it into batches. Once again, PyTorch provides a <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataloader.html#DataLoader\">DataLoader</a> class that can automate this, but it's about the same difficulty in this example to implement by hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we iterate through the batches. We zero out the accumulated information in the optimizer, feed the batch through the model, and compute the loss for a batch. We use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy\">cross entropy</a>, a common metric for classifiers. This loss is added to a running total for the epoch, and then we <em>backpropagate</em> it. Backpropagation is a mathematical determination of how much each weight in the model should be changed relative to the others to reduce the loss. The optimizer then takes a step and updates the weights.\n",
        "\n",
